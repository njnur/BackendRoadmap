### SQL vs NoSQL

**SQL** and **NoSQL** are two different types of database management systems (DBMS). SQL stands for Structured Query
Language, and NoSQL stands for Not Only SQL.

**SQL databases** are relational databases, meaning that they store data in tables with rows and columns. Tables are
related to each other through foreign keys, which allow you to query data from multiple tables at the same time. SQL
databases are well-suited for storing structured data, such as customer information, product inventory, and financial
transactions.

**NoSQL databases** are non-relational databases, meaning that they do not store data in tables. Instead, NoSQL
databases can store data in a variety of different formats, such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, and wide-column
stores. NoSQL databases are well-suited for storing semi-structured or unstructured data, such as social media posts,
sensor data, and log files.

| Query language | SQL                                                      | Varies by database type                                             |
| Scalability    | Vertical                                                 | Horizontal                                                          |
| Use cases      | Structured data, complex queries, transaction management | Semi-structured or unstructured data, high performance, scalability |

**When to use SQL**

SQL databases are a good choice for applications that need to store structured data and perform complex queries. SQL
databases are also a good choice for applications that need to support high transaction throughput.

**Examples of SQL databases:**

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle Database
* Microsoft SQL Server

**When to use NoSQL**

NoSQL databases are a good choice for applications that need to store semi-structured or unstructured data. NoSQL
databases are also a good choice for applications that need to scale horizontally to handle large amounts of data.

**Examples of NoSQL databases:**

* MongoDB
* Cassandra
* DynamoDB
* CouchDB

**Which database should you use?**

The best database for you will depend on your specific needs. If you need to store structured data and perform complex
queries, then a SQL database is a good choice. If you need to store semi-structured or unstructured data, or if you need
to scale horizontally, then a NoSQL database is a good choice.

Here are some additional factors to consider when choosing a database:

* **Performance:** Some databases are faster than others, depending on the type of queries you need to run and the size
  of your dataset.
* **Scalability:** Some databases can scale better than others, meaning they can handle more data and traffic.
* **Cost:** Some databases are more expensive than others.
* **Features:** Some databases offer more features than others, such as support for full-text search or geospatial
  queries.
