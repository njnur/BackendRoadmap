# Counting Documents in MongoDB

Counting documents in MongoDB is a common operation that allows you to determine the number of documents that match a
specific query within a collection. Accurate counts are essential for monitoring data, optimizing performance, and
making informed decisions. MongoDB provides various methods to count documents. Let's explore these methods with
examples:

## `countDocuments` Method

The `countDocuments` method is the preferred way to count documents in MongoDB, especially for newer versions of the
database (MongoDB 3.6 and later). It provides a more accurate count of documents and supports query filters.

### Example:

Suppose you have a collection named "users" and you want to count the number of users with a specific age, say 30:

```javascript
const filter = {age: 30};
const count = await db.collection('users').countDocuments(filter);
console.log(`Number of users with age 30: ${count}`);
```

## Aggregation Framework

You can also use the aggregation framework to count documents. The `$group` stage is used to group documents and
the `$sum` operator to count them.

### Example:

Suppose you have a collection of sales orders and want to count the number of orders for each product:

```javascript
db.collection('sales').aggregate([
    {$group: {_id: "$product", count: {$sum: 1}}}
], (err, result) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        return;
    }
    console.log(result);
});
```

Using the aggregation framework allows you to perform more complex counting operations, such as counting documents based
on multiple criteria.
