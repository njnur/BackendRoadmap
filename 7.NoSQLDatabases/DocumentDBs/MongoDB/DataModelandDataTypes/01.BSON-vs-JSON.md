# BSON vs JSON

When it comes to data interchange and storage, BSON (Binary JSON) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) are two
prominent formats, each with distinct characteristics and use cases.

## JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

- **Format**: JSON is a text-based format that stores data as key-value pairs.
- **Human-Readable**: JSON is designed for human readability and is easy to understand and edit.
- **Data Types**: It supports basic data types like strings, numbers, arrays, and objects.
- **Language Compatibility**: JSON is language-independent and widely supported.
- **Use Cases**: JSON is ideal for configuration files, web APIs, and scenarios where human readability is a priority.

### Example JSON Object:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}
```

## BSON (Binary JSON)

- **Format**: BSON is a binary format optimized for storage and data retrieval.
- **Efficiency**: It is more space-efficient due to its binary nature, making it faster for data operations.
- **Data Types**: BSON extends JSON by including data types like dates, regular expressions, and binary data.
- **Use Cases**: BSON is primarily used in databases like MongoDB, where efficient storage and complex querying are
  crucial.

### Example BSON Object (Equivalent to JSON Example):

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId(
  "5f13f12a0ffaca56f758d90c"
  ),
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}
```

## Choosing Between BSON and JSON

- **Use JSON** for scenarios where human-readability and simplicity are paramount, such as configuration files and web
  APIs.
- **Use BSON** when efficiency, fast storage, and complex data structures are essential, particularly in database
  systems like MongoDB.
