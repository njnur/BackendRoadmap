## Git

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, track
changes, and manage source code efficiently. It provides a way to keep a complete history of all changes made to a
project and enables easy branching, merging, and collaboration among developers.

### How Git Works

1. **Repository**: Git operates within a repository, which is a directory that contains all the files and folders of
   your project. It tracks changes made to these files over time.

2. **Commits**: Git tracks changes through commits. A commit represents a snapshot of the repository at a specific point
   in time. Each commit has a unique identifier called a hash, and it contains information about the changes made,
   including the author, timestamp, and a message describing the changes.

3. **Branches**: Git allows the creation of branches, which are independent lines of development. Branching allows you
   to work on new features or make changes without affecting the main codebase. It facilitates collaboration and
   experimentation.

4. **Merge**: Git enables merging branches back together. Merging combines changes from one branch into another. This is
   useful when a feature is complete or when changes in multiple branches need to be combined.

5. **Remote Repositories**: Git supports remote repositories, which are versions of the repository hosted on remote
   servers. Remote repositories enable collaboration and allow multiple developers to work on the same project. Common
   remote hosting platforms include GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

### Git Examples

1. **Initializing a Repository**: To start using Git in a project, you can initialize a repository using the `git init`
   command. This creates a new Git repository in the current directory.

2. **Creating Commits**: After making changes to your project, you can create a commit to record those changes using the
   following commands:
   ```
   git add <file1> <file2>   # Stage files for commit
   git commit -m "Commit message"   # Create a new commit with a message
   ```

3. **Branching**: To create a new branch in Git, you can use the `git branch` command:
   ```
   git branch <branch-name>   # Create a new branch
   ```

4. **Merging**: To merge changes from one branch to another, you can use the `git merge` command:
   ```
   git checkout <branch-to-merge-into>   # Switch to the target branch
   git merge <branch-to-merge>   # Merge changes from the specified branch
   ```

5. **Working with Remote Repositories**: Git allows you to interact with remote repositories. Here's an example
   workflow:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>   # Clone a remote repository to your local machine
   git pull   # Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository
   git push   # Push your local changes to the remote repository
   ```

These examples provide a glimpse into Git's functionality, but there are many more commands and features available. Git
is a powerful tool for version control and collaboration in software development.
