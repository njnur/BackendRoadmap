A **domain name** is a unique address that identifies a website on the internet. It serves as a human-readable label
that corresponds to a specific IP address, allowing users to access websites easily without needing to remember complex
numeric IP addresses.

Domain names are composed of two main parts: the **top-level domain (TLD)** and the **second-level domain (SLD)**. The
TLD is the rightmost part of the domain name, such as `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, or country-specific TLDs like `.uk`
or `.jp`. The SLD appears to the left of the TLD and is the main part that identifies the website or organization, such
as "example" in `"example.com"`.

For example, in the domain name `"openai.com"`, `"openai"` is the SLD, and `".com"` is the TLD. Together, they form the
complete domain name.

Domain names play a crucial role in website identification, branding, and online presence. They are registered and
managed through **domain registrars**, which allow individuals and organizations to reserve and control their desired
domain names for a specific period, typically on a yearly basis.
