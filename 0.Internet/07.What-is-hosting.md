**Hosting** refers to the process of storing and making a website or web application accessible on the internet. When
you create a website, you need a place to store its files, data, and other content. Hosting provides the necessary
infrastructure and services to make your website available for visitors to access.

Here are some key points about hosting:

1. **Server Infrastructure:** Hosting involves utilizing servers, which are powerful computers that store and serve your
   website's files. These servers are connected to the internet and designed to handle incoming requests for your
   website.

2. **Storage Space:** Hosting providers allocate storage space on their servers to store your website's files, including
   HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, videos, and other assets.

3. **Server Management:** Hosting providers handle the maintenance, security, and technical aspects of server
   management. This includes server setup, software updates, security patches, backups, and ensuring the server remains
   operational.

4. **Bandwidth and Data Transfer:** Hosting plans often include a specific amount of bandwidth or data transfer.
   Bandwidth refers to the amount of data that can be transferred between your website and its visitors. If your website
   has heavy traffic or large file sizes, you may require a hosting plan with higher bandwidth limits.

5. **Domain and DNS Management:** Hosting providers often offer domain registration services, allowing you to acquire
   and manage your domain name. They may also provide domain name system (DNS) management, which associates your domain
   name with the correct server IP address.

6. **Types of Hosting:** There are various types of hosting available, including shared hosting, virtual private
   servers (VPS), dedicated servers, cloud hosting, and more. Each type offers different levels of resources, control,
   and scalability to accommodate different website needs.

When you choose a hosting provider, you typically sign up for a hosting plan that suits your website's requirements. The
provider will allocate server resources and provide the necessary tools and interfaces to manage your website, email
accounts, databases, and other aspects of your online presence.

Remember that hosting is separate from domain registration. While hosting provides the infrastructure for your website,
a domain name is the address that visitors use to access your website. You can register a domain name separately and
then connect it to your hosting account.
